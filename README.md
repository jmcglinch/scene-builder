This app demos a generic approach to building visual scenes from XML. The application could consume an XML stream from a backend service such that the visualization updates based on the calculated data stream.  Key components include:

 * the XML resource
 * Entity objects with Graphics2D paint method
 * Timeline and scenario generators using Trident library
 * the scene component which creates the JPanel object and invokes scenario
